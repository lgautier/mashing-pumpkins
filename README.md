# mashing-pumpkins

minhashing-related miscellanea

Not much to read about it beside the notebooks in the [doc/](doc/) and docstrings in the code.

[MASH](https://github.com/marbl/Mash) and [sourmash](https://github.com/dib-lab/sourmash) started it all. They have good documentation. Check them out !

## Installation

Python 3.5 and a C++ compiler are pretty much everything needed. With pip, installing the "master" branch can be done with:

`pip install git+https://https://github.com/lgautier/mashing-pumpkins.git`


### Misc.

```
Q: Why Python 3-only ?
A: Because I am coming from the future...
